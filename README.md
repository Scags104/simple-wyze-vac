# Simple Wyze Vacuum for Home Assistant

Simple implementation of the Wyze Vacuum right into Home Assistant. 

## Prerequisites
- Home Assistant ðŸ˜…
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) Installed in Home Assistant
- Wyze Account without 2FA - Tip: Create a new account that you share just the vacuum with that doesn't have 2FA enabled.

## Installation
1. On Home Assistant go to HACS -> Integration
2. Click menu on the top right
3. Click on custom repositories
4. Add https://github.com/romedtino/simple-wyze-vac as an Integration
5. Edit your configuration.yaml and add
```yaml
simple_wyze_vac:
  username: your_wyze_email@email.com
  password: your_wyze_password
```
6. Restart Home Assistant

If it all worked out, you should now have Wyze vacuum entity(ies)

```yaml
service: vacuum.set_fan_speed
data:
  fan_speed: quiet
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.your_vac
```
- Battery Level

## Misc
- Location is not supported but it is considered "supported" by HA so the button doesn't crash the component when using vacuum-card if you use it.


## TODO / Maybe in the Future
- In theory everything from wyze-sdk should be possible?
- Currently using a forked version of wyze-sdk which fixes the login issue and showing battery levels. Need to revert back to using pypi release by shauntarves once he's updated his repo.
